# inaugural_addresses

I scraped all of the U.S. presidential inagural addresses from http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/inaugurals.php using the Scrapy python library. 

Then, I did a textual analysis of the addresses to figure out how many non-stop words were used, and how frequently they were used over the year. 

You can change the top number of words displayed at the top of index.py and run python index.py to see the top words used, and see their usage displayed in a line graph made in matplotlib.
